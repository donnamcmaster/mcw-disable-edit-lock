McWebby WP Disable Edit Lock
--

Temporarily allows multiple admins to access one post record. 

Situation
--
To avoid admins stepping on each others' changes, WordPress locks a page/post whenever someone goes in to edit it. This prevents anyone else from viewing or modifying the file. 

But it presents a problem when you are working remotely with a client or another administrator, trying to train them to use the admin interface or to help troubleshoot a problem. You need a way for both of you to view the edit screen, even though only one of you is making changes. 

Solution
--
If you activate this tiny plugin, it will soften the Edit Lock to a warning message. When you finish the training session, just disable the plugin. 

Warning
--
If you're not sure you can remember to disable it when you're finished, you may want to think twice about using it, as it will allow one person's edits to overwrite another's.
